# ReportDiff

### *Review and analysis of attending edits of radiology trainee reports*
 
ReportDiff is a system designed to provide automated feedback for resident dictated reports.  The system consists of several components:

* A retrieval script queries the Powerscribe 360 server and retrieves trainee-signed preliminary reports every few minutes.  It also periodically queries the server for final versions of cached preliminary reports.  It computes the edit differences between preliminary and final reports.
* R scripts are used to analyze aggregate report data.
* A web service (ReportDiff_Flask) presents the reports and edit scores generated by the retriever.

The system will be presented in more detail as an educational exhibit at the 2015 meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

The main retrieval script is ps_reportdiff.py (Python 2.7).  The analysis script (analysis.R) uses the R statistical environment, and requires configuration of database locations at the beginning of the file.  The ggplot2 library is used to generate graphs.

This project uses code from the following open source projects:
